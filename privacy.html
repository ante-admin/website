                            <h2>Types of Personal Data Processed and the Legal Basis for Their Processing</h2>
                            <p>We collect various types of personal data through direct inputs from you, automatic detection by our systems, or via the device's operating system when you engage with our App. Our collection is limited strictly to what is essential to deliver our services effectively.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Email Address: Collected when you register to use the App. We process this data under the necessity of performing our contract with you. Without such information, we cannot offer our services to logged-in users, although guest access remains available. You may later link your guest account to a registered profile. Additionally, we may use your email for direct marketing related to similar products or services. This is based on our legitimate interest in marketing, but you can opt out at any time before and after receiving marketing communications. We retain minimal data necessary to respect your opt-out preferences.</li>
                                <li>Social Network Data through OAuth: This includes information from your public social media profiles (e.g., Facebook), which you control. This data is processed to fulfill our contractual obligations, allowing us to provide services to registered users.</li>
                                <li>Name and Avatar: Processed based on your consent when you choose to upload these to represent yourself in the App. You can modify your name and avatar anytime within the App settings.</li>
                                <li>Date of Birth: Collected when you provide it to our support team for promotional gifts. We only store the day and month to minimize the personal data we retain, processing this information based on your consent.</li>
                                <li>Customer Support Communications: Used solely for the performance of our contract, to respond to your inquiries and provide support. This information is not used for profiling or marketing purposes.</li>
                                <li>Server Logs: Includes your device's requests to our server, device details, browser specifications, IP address, timestamps, geographical data, operating system, and network information. This data is essential for the operation of the App, processed under our contractual obligation to enable connectivity and functionality.</li>
                                <li>Advertising Identifiers: Such as IDFA or GAID, collected based on your consent via device settings. You have the option to reset these identifiers or opt out of targeted advertising through your device's settings, which we fully respect.</li>
                                <li>Device Identifiers: Includes IDs provided by your operating system or those we assign, like your in-App ID. These are processed due to our legitimate interest in preventing fraud and unauthorized access, ensuring the App's operational security and availability.</li>
                                <li>Technical Information: Such as App version, operating system details, browser type, device model, and language. This information is necessary for the proper functioning of the App on your device, processed to fulfill our contractual duties.</li>
                                <li>Usage Data: Includes logs, events, hands played, transaction history, App crashes, and system reports. This statistical data, processed both under our contractual obligations and our legitimate interests, aids in fraud prevention and enhances App security and functionality. It also allows us to improve the App based on user interaction, without infringing on your rights or disclosing any sensitive personal information.</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                            <h2>Utilization of Your Personal Data</h2>
                            <h3>Security Measures and Data Usage:</h3>
                            <p>Encryption and Storage: We ensure the confidentiality of your personal data by encrypting your passwords at the time of registration. Subsequently, we store your data on secure servers designed to prevent unauthorized access or data loss.</p>
                            <p>Advertising Identifiers: We adhere to the strict guidelines set by operating systems for using advertising identifiers. Our use of these identifiers is solely to fulfill our contractual obligations with our partners who direct traffic to and from our App, whether it be through advertising banners, video ads, or other means.</p>
                            <h3>Communication Practices:</h3>
                            <p>Marketing Communications: Unless you opt out, we may occasionally contact you via email to inform you about products and services similar to those you currently use. In all communications, we provide a clear and easy way for you to opt out both before receiving the first marketing message and at any subsequent time.</p>
                            <h3>Purposes for Data Processing:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Service Provision: To provide and manage the services you have requested.</li>
                                <li>Fraud Prevention: To detect and prevent fraudulent activities.</li>

                                <li>Updates and Notifications: To inform you about any significant changes to our services that may affect your experience or usage.</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                            <h2>Retention of Personal Data</h2>
                            <h3>Duration of Storage:</h3>
                            <p>We retain your personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes it was collected. Personal data is stored either until you uninstall the App or if there has been no activity on your account for six months. Certain types of data, such as IP addresses or blacklisted email addresses used for fraud prevention, may be retained longer in our legitimate interest to protect our business from financial loss and to honor your marketing opt-outs.</p>
                            <h3>Deletion Policy:</h3>
                            <p>In compliance with legal requirements, we remove any information that is no longer needed for service provision. If your account remains inactive for over six months, we consider this a "Period of Inactivity" and will subsequently delete any personal data we hold. However, should you choose to return, you are welcome to re-register and begin anew.</p>
                            <h3>Data Security Measures</h3>
                            <p>Data Storage and Protection: Your personal data is securely stored on servers leased from third-party hosting providers, including Hetzner and Amazon.
