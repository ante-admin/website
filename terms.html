                        <h2>Virtual Items</h2>
                        <p>During your use of the Service, you may win, earn, or purchase Virtual Items with real-world money. There is no obligation to purchase any Virtual Items at any time. Virtual Items can only be used within the games they are associated with and you have no actual ownership or entitlement to the Virtual Items that appear or originate in any game, whether "earned" or "purchased". These items are licensed to you by us for your personal use within the game. It is prohibited to purchase, sell, or transfer Virtual Items outside of the Service, or to attempt to sell any item that appears or originates in the Service in the "real world". Any attempt to do so is void and may lead to termination of your Account and possible legal action. While you may trade Virtual Items within a game, it must be in compliance with the game's rules and never in exchange for real money. Other than the limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Virtual Items with the Services, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Items. We reserve the right to manage, regulate, control, modify, and eliminate Virtual Items at our discretion, and we will not be liable to you or anyone else for exercising these rights. We may also remove or revoke your license to use Virtual Items associated with your Account without notice and at our discretion. Prices and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.</p>
                        <p>Virtual Items are only available to legal residents of jurisdictions where access to and use of the Services are permitted. Virtual Items may only be purchased or acquired directly from us or through our authorized web store, or through the applicable platform (such as the Google Play Store or Apple App Store). We reserve the right to refuse your request to purchase or acquire Virtual Items for any reason. When you purchase Virtual Items, they will remain in your Account until used within the Services, unless otherwise removed or revoked by us.</p>
                        <p>Depending on your platform, any Virtual Item purchased through your platform is subject to the terms and conditions and user agreement of that platform. Usage rights for each purchase may vary. If you are unsure about the usage rights, you should check with your platform before making a purchase.</p>
                        <p>When you purchase Virtual Items, you agree to pay the applicable charges for your purchase, including applicable taxes, through the appropriate store. If your transaction with our payment processing partners fails, then your purchase will not be completed. If the payment transaction is successful, your purchase will be fulfilled as soon as possible – we strive to fulfill your order immediately at the point of purchase.</p>
                        <p>If you do not connect the games on a device to your Account (either directly or through your social network account), we will not be able to restore any Virtual Items (whether purchased by you, or otherwise credited or awarded to you) or other data associated with your gameplay to a different device (including if you lose that device or it is damaged). We are not liable for any loss or deletion of Virtual Items, whether purchased by you or granted by us without a purchase, or for any data associated with your gameplay, from a device not connected to an account.</p>
